#  Doubledown Casino to Start Sports Betting in Florida

Doubledown casino is all set to foray into the sports betting market of Florida. The company has already obtained a license from the state’s gaming commission and is now gearing up for an official launch.

The initial roll-out will be in the form of a soft launch, which will allow players in specific test markets to place bets on sporting events. Once everything is finalized and operational, the full-scale sports betting offering will be made available to all residents of Florida.

Doubledown casino is not new to the sports betting market. The company has been operational in New Jersey since June of this year. It has also launched its services in West Virginia and Mississippi recently. With the expansion into Florida, Doubledown casino will have a presence in four states.

The decision to expand into Florida was driven by the state’s recent approval of sports betting legislation. In May, Florida lawmakers passed a bill that allows licensed casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting services. The law came into effect on July 1st and Doubledown casino wasted no time in obtaining a license.

According to John Acres, President of Doubledown casino, the company is looking forward to offering its products and services to the residents of Florida. He believes that there is a lot of potential for growth in the state and that Doubledown casino is well positioned to take advantage of it.

#  Doubledown Casino Bringing Sports Betting to Florida!

Residents in the Sunshine State will soon be able to place bets on their favorite sports teams, as Doubledown Casino has announced it will be bringing its online sports betting platform to Florida.

The move comes as states across the U.S. are legalizing and regulating sports betting, following a Supreme Court decision last year that overturned a federal law preventing states from authorizing sports betting.

Doubledown Casino is one of the largest providers of online gambling services in the U.S., offering blackjack, poker, slots and now sports betting to its customers. The company already operates in 16 states, and plans to expand into Florida later this year.

Florida has been slow to legalize sports betting, due in part to opposition from the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which operates casinos in the state. The tribe has threatened to sue if the state moves ahead with plans to legalize sports betting.

Despite the opposition, lawmakers in Florida appear poised to legalize sports betting this year. The state Senate last month approved a bill that would allow regulated sports betting, and the House is expected to take up the issue soon.

If passed, Doubledown Casino’s online sports betting platform would be among the first in Florida. Several other companies are also preparing to launch operations in the state once it legalizes sports betting.
