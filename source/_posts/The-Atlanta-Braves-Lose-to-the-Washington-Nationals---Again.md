#  The Atlanta Braves Lose to the Washington Nationals - Again

The Braves lost to the Nationals 6-4 on Wednesday night. It was their fourth consecutive loss to Washington. The Braves are now in third place in the National League East, 9.5 games behind the Nationals.

This was not a good game for the Braves. They only had four hits and two of them were home runs by Freddie Freeman and Nick Markakis. Their starting pitcher, Mike Foltynewicz, was not effective and was pulled in the fourth inning after giving up four runs.

The Nationals got off to a fast start, scoring two runs in the first inning. They added two more runs in the third inning, one of which was scored by Bryce Harper who hit his 20th home run of the season. The Nationals then added two more runs in the fourth inning, one of which was scored by Michael A. Taylor who hit his ninth home run of the season.

The Braves made a gallant effort to come back, scoring two runs in the seventh inning and three runs in the eighth inning, but it was not enough and they lost 6-4. Ender Inciarte had an RBI single in the seventh inning and Freeman had an RBI double in the eighth inning.

This loss dropped the Braves' record to 43-45 and they are now 9.5 games behind the Nationals who have a record of 52-37. The Braves will have an opportunity to get back into contention when they play the Nationals again later this week at home.

#  The Braves Lose Third Straight Game to Fall Back in NL East Race

The Braves lost their third straight game and dropped back in the NL East race.

Atlanta was shut out 3-0 by the Washington Nationals, falling to 8.5 games behind first-place Philadelphia. The Braves have now lost 10 of their last 12 games.

"We're just not playing well right now," said Braves catcher Brian McCann. "We've just got to find a way to turn it around."

The Nationals, who are in last place in the National League East, scored all three of their runs in the second inning off Braves starter Jair Jurrjens. They added an insurance run in the ninth inning off reliever Peter Moylan.

Washington starter Livan Hernandez went six innings, allowing four hits and no runs. He improved to 5-5 on the season. Braves reliever Mike Dunn took the loss, dropping him to 0-2 on the year.

#  3 Straight Losses for the Braves Means Slipping in the Standings

The Braves have now lost three straight games after falling to the Nationals on Wednesday night. This losing streak has them slipping in the standings, as they are now in fourth place in the National League East.

This losing streak began with a frustrating 3-2 loss to the Phillies on Sunday. The Braves had an early 2-0 lead, but they couldn’t hold onto it. It only got worse from there, as they were blown out 8-1 by the Nationals on Monday and then 8-2 by the Mets on Tuesday.

Wednesday’s game was much closer, but the Nationals still managed to come out on top 5-4. The Braves had a 4-3 lead in the seventh inning, but they couldn’t make it stand up.

There are still 46 games left in the season, but these three losses have put a damper on things. The Braves will need to turn things around if they want to make a run at the playoffs.

#  Braves Lose Third in a Row, Falling Further Behind in Division Race

The Braves lost their third game in a row on Wednesday night, falling further behind the division-leading Nationals. Washington now has a six-game lead over Atlanta.

It was another rough outing for Braves starter Lucas Sims, who allowed five runs in 4 innings. The bullpen also struggled, allowing four more runs.

The Braves have now lost 10 of their last 12 games and they are in danger of falling out of contention in the NL East. They will need to turn things around quickly if they want to make a run at the playoffs.

There are still 63 games remaining in the regular season and the Braves are only four games back of the second Wild Card spot. But it's going to be tough to make up that ground without some major improvements.

For now, the Braves will have to focus on winning games against division rivals like the Nationals. They head to Washington for a four-game series starting on Thursday night.

#  Braves Fall to Nationals Again After Dropping Third Straight Game

The Braves have now dropped three in a row after falling to the Nationals 6-2 on Sunday. Atlanta has lost five of their last six games and sit in fourth place in the NL East.

Washington got on the board in the first inning after Anthony Rendon hit an RBI single to score Bryce Harper. The Nationals added two more runs in the inning, one coming off a Ryan Zimmerman homer.

Atlanta got on the board in the third inning when Ozzie Albies hit an RBI single to score Johan Camargo. In the fifth inning, Freddie Freeman hit a solo homer to make it a 3-2 game. But Washington would add some insurance runs later in the game to secure the victory.

It was another tough outing for Braves starter Mike Foltynewicz, who allowed six runs (five earned) over four innings of work. He falls to 2-5 on the season with a 6.02 ERA.

The Braves will look to get back in the win column on Tuesday when they take on the Nationals again at Nationals Park. First pitch is scheduled for 7:05 PM ET.
