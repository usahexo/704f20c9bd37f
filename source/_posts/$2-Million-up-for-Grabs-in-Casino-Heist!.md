#  $2 Million up for Grabs in Casino Heist!

Las Vegas, Nevada - The Bellagio casino was the scene of a robbery late last night as a man walked into the casino and made his way to the high roller area, where he pulled out a gun and demanded money from the players.

The man, who has been identified as Jimmy Biggs, made off with over $2 million in cash and chips, but was later arrested after a car chase with police.

This is not the first time that Biggs has been involved in a casino robbery - In 2009, he walked into the Atlantic City casino and made off with over $1 million.

The Bellagio robbery is believed to be one of the biggest in Las Vegas history, and officials are still trying to determine how Biggs was able to get away with so much money.

In addition to the cash stolen from the casino, Biggs also made off with several high-value watches and other jewelry.
