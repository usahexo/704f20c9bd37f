#  How to Make a Slot Machine Card Box 

In this tutorial, we’re going to show you how to make a slot machine card box. This is a great way to store and protect your playing cards, and it also makes for an impressive decoration or gift.

The first step is to cut out the pieces for the box. For the front and back panels, you will need two rectangular pieces measuring 10x6 inches. The sides of the box will measure 5x5 inches, and the top and bottom will be rectangular pieces measuring 6x2 inches.

Next, you will need to score the panels using a craft knife or bone folder. To do this, line up the craft knife or bone folder at each corner of the panel and press down firmly, then drag it towards the center of the panel until it reaches the scored line. Do this on all four corners of each panel.

Now it’s time to fold the panels into thirds. Place one panel in front of you with the scored lines facing up. Fold one end up towards the center, then fold the other end up so that it overlaps slightly with the first fold. Now press down on both folds to secure them.

Do this same process with all of the other panels, then use a hot glue gun to secure them all together into a box shape. Be sure to leave an opening on one side so that you can insert your playing cards.

To finish, you can use a hot glue gun to attach some decorations if desired. We used metallic gold paper and sequins for our slot machine, but you can use whatever you like best!

#  How to Turn a Regular Card Box into a Slot Machine 

There are plenty of reasons why you might want to turn a regular card box into a slot machine. Maybe you’re throwing a casino-themed party and you want to give your guests some extra entertainment, or maybe you just think it would be fun to have your own personal slot machine to play around with. No matter what your reason may be, this tutorial will show you how to do it.

The first thing you need to do is take the card box and cut out two rectangular pieces from the front and back. The size of these pieces will depend on the size of your card box, but they should be big enough so that the front and back of the box can close completely.

Once you’ve cut out the pieces, use a glue gun to attach them to the top and bottom of the box. Make sure that the slots are facing inwards so that the cards can be inserted properly.

Now it’s time to make the lever. Cut out a small piece of cardboard and then use a glue gun to attach it to one end of the box. This will be your lever!

The last step is to make the payout tray. Cut out a small square from some cardboard and then use a glue gun to attach it to the inside of the box, near the top. This will be where your winnings are deposited when you hit the jackpot!

Your slot machine is now ready for action! To play, insert a card into each of the slots and then pull back on the lever. If you match three symbols on any of the cards, you’ll win!
