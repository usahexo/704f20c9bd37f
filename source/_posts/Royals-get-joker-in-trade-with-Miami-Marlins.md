#  Royals get joker in trade with Miami Marlins

The Kansas City Royals announced a trade early Thursday morning with the Miami Marlins that sent outfielder Jorge Soler to Miami in exchange for reliever Kyle Barraclough.

Infielder Starlin Castro and cash considerations will also go to Kansas City in the deal.

The trade comes as a bit of a surprise, as Soler had just been designated for assignment by the Royals on Sunday.

Barraclough, who is arbitration-eligible this offseason, was 3-2 with a 2.93 ERA and 12 saves in 66 appearances for the Marlins in 2018.

The 28-year-old has spent his entire six-year career with Miami after being drafted by the team in the fourth round of the 2012 draft.

Soler, 26, hit .237/.310/.467 with 11 home runs and 44 RBIs over 103 games for Kansas City in 2018. He was originally acquired by the Royals from the Chicago Cubs in December 2016 as part of the trade that sent All-Star closer Wade Davis to Chicago.

#  Joker represents new hope for Royals

There are high expectations for the Royals this year. Many experts have predicted that they will finish in first place in the American League Central Division. After finishing in third place last year, the Royals are hoping to make a trip to the playoffs.

One of the reasons for the Royals' optimism is their young roster. Many of their players are in the early stages of their careers and have yet to reach their full potential. One of these players is third baseman Mike Moustakas, who hit .284 with 12 home runs last year.

Another player who could play a big role this season is outfielder Jarrod Dyson. Dyson was acquired from the Seattle Mariners in February and is expected to play a major role as a late-inning pinch runner and defensive replacement.

The player who may have the biggest impact on the Royals this season, however, is outfielder Lorenzo Cain. Cain was acquired from the Milwaukee Brewers before last season and had a breakout year, hitting .300 with 16 home runs and 54 RBIs. He also won a Gold Glove Award for his outstanding defense.

The Royals are also expecting big things from pitcher Yordano Ventura. Ventura had an up-and-down rookie season but showed signs of brilliance, including an impressive start against the Los Angeles Angels in which he struck out 11 batters in six innings.

Although there are high expectations for the Royals this season, there are also some questions marks. The biggest question mark is whether or not their starting rotation can hold up over an extended period of time. In addition, their bullpen, which was among the best in baseball last year, lost Greg Holland to free agency.

Despite these question marks, the Royals have enough talent to contend for a playoff berth this season. If they can stay healthy and get some help from their young players, they could very well end up winning the division and making it to the postseason for the first time since 1985.

#  What does a joker mean in blackjack? Ask the Royals

In blackjack, a joker is a card that can be used in place of any other card to make a desired hand. For example, if a player is dealt two sevens and needs another card to make 21, the joker can be used as the third seven to complete the hand. The joker can also be used in place of an ace to form a Blackjack.

#  Kansas City Royals use joker to beat Cleveland Indians

In a game that was filled with controversy and bizarre plays, the Kansas City Royals pulled off an 8-6 victory over the Cleveland Indians. This game had it all - a three-run homer in the first inning, a blown save by Cody Allen, a questionable ruling at first base, and a game-winning RBI by pinch hitter Drew Butera.

The Royals got on the board early, as Whit Merrifield hit a three-run homer in the top of the first inning. The Indians responded with four runs in the bottom of the inning, as Edwin Encarnacion hit a two-run homer and Michael Brantley added a solo shot.

The Royals regained the lead in the sixth inning, as Salvador Perez hit an RBI single to give them a 5-4 advantage. However, Cody Allen was able to get out of a bases-loaded jam and preserve Cleveland's one-run lead.

Kansas City took the lead for good in the eighth inning. With runners on first and third and one out, Alcides Escobar hit a grounder to second baseman Jason Kipnis. Kipnis was unable to make the play at first base, as Eric Hosmer was able to score from third base. This proved to be the game-winning run.

Drew Butera came up big for Kansas City in this game. With two outs and runners on first and second in the ninth inning, he hit an RBI single to give his team an 8-6 lead. Butera then proceeded to pitch two scoreless innings to earn the save.

#  Joker shines in Royals' victory over Detroit Tigers

The Kansas City Royals came into Wednesday night's game against the Detroit Tigers looking to make up for a lackluster performance in their previous game. The Royals did just that, with a 6-3 victory.

Jorge Bonifacio got the scoring started for the Royals in the second inning with a solo home run. Bonifacio had another big hit in the fifth inning, driving in two runs with a single to give the Royals a 3-0 lead.

In his first start of the season, Jakob Junis was impressive. Junis went six innings, allowing just two hits and one run while striking out six batters.

The Royals added some insurance runs in the eighth inning. With runners on first and second, Alex Gordon drove in one run with a single, and then Francisco Pena drove in another run with a double.

Royals closer Kelvin Herrera got into some trouble in the ninth inning, but he was able to get out of it and earn his fourth save of the season.

The Royals are now 9-6 on the season and will look to keep things going when they take on the Tigers again on Thursday night.
