#  Nevada Woman Wins Huge Jackpot, But Faces Federal Tax Hurdle

Las Vegas, Nevada - Federal law dictates that any gambling winnings over $5,000 must be declared as income and taxed. This is a problem for 47-year-old Kelly Harrell, who won a whopping $6.4 million playing the slots at the Bellagio Resort in Las Vegas.

Harrell has no intention of paying the 39.6% federal tax bill on her windfall, and is currently consulting with lawyers to see if there is any way she can avoid it. "I worked hard for this money," she said. "I shouldn't have to give it all away to the government."

The good news for Harrell is that there may be a loophole in the tax code that could allow her to keep at least some of her winnings. According to experts, if she can prove that the money was won through gambling losses, she may be able to reduce her taxable income by the amount of those losses.

"It's not an easy argument to make, but it's not impossible," said one lawyer. "There are cases where people have been successful in reducing their tax liability this way."

If Harrell is forced to pay the full amount owed, she will still end up with a net worth of millions of dollars. But even with all that money coming in, she will still face some financial challenges. For one thing, she will need to find a new place to live; her modest home in Nevada is not nearly big enough for a millionaire.

She also plans to set aside some money for her children's education and for retirement. And finally, she wants to take some time off from work and travel the world. "This has been a dream come true," she said. "I never imagined I would win so much money."

#  Gambling Winnings Could Result in Hefty Tax Bill

You've just hit the jackpot, and you're counting your money - Exciting times! But don't forget, the Internal Revenue Service will be expecting their share of your winnings.

Gambling winnings are considered taxable income in the United States. This means that you will need to report any gambling winnings on your tax return, and you may be subject to a tax bill on them.

The good news is that there is a deduction available for gambling losses. This can help to offset some of the taxes that you may owe on your gambling winnings. However, it's important to note that you can only claim losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you won $1,000 but lost $2,000 while gambling, you can only claim a deduction of $1,000.

If you have any questions about how gambling winnings are taxed, or about how to report them on your tax return, please contact a tax professional.

# Taxing Times for Big-Time Gamblers

If you're a high roller betting on sports or playing the slots in Las Vegas, your tax bill is about to go up.

The Tax Cut and Jobs Act, passed by Congress in December 2017 and signed into law by President Donald Trump, includes a new excise tax on gambling services. The 21 percent tax will be levied on the net income of casinos, racetracks, and other gambling businesses.

Gambling has always been a taxable activity, but the new tax is much broader than previous levies. It applies not just to casino games but also to online gambling and even lotteries.

The idea behind the new tax is to make sure that casinos and other gambling businesses pay their share of federal taxes. The industry has long been exempt from certain taxes that other businesses are subject to, such as payroll and income taxes.

The gambling industry was quick to criticize the new tax. The American Gaming Association (AGA) said it would lead to job losses and reduced investment in casinos. AGA president Geoff Freeman said the tax would be "a crippling blow" to an industry that employs more than 1 million people nationwide.

Supporters of the new tax say it will bring in much-needed revenue for the federal government. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that the tax will raise more than $1 billion over the next decade.

So far there's no indication that the new tax has had a negative effect on casino business or employment. In fact, casino stocks have been doing well since the passage of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.

#  How Much of Your Winnings Will You Have to Pay in Taxes?

There is no one definitive answer to the question of how much of your gambling winnings you will have to pay in taxes. The amount you owe in taxes will depend on a variety of factors, including your federal and state tax rates, the size of your winnings, and how you earned the money.

However, there are some general rules that can help you estimate how much of your gambling winnings you will have to pay in taxes. For example, if you won a jackpot worth more than $5,000, then you will likely need to pay federal taxes on the money. Additionally, most states also require residents to pay taxes on gambling winnings.

Fortunately, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offers a variety of resources to help taxpayers understand their tax obligations related to gambling wins. The agencyâ€™s website includes a section on gambling income and expenses, which includes information on what types of gambling income are taxable and what deductions taxpayers can claim.

If you have any questions about how much of your gambling winnings you will have to pay in taxes, be sure to consult with a tax professional.

#  What Are the Federal Taxes on Gambling Winnings?

The federal taxes on gambling winnings vary depending on the amount won and the type of gambling. Generally, gambling winnings are taxable income.

For most kinds of gambling winnings, the taxpayer must report the full amount as income in the year it was won. This is true whether or not the taxpayer actually receives a Form W-2G, which is a document from the payer that shows the amount of winnings and how much tax was withheld.

However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, taxpayers don't have to report as income any winnings from bingo, keno, or slot machines that are reported on Form W-2G. And taxpayers can exclude up to $5,000 in gambling winnings (or $600 if they file a joint return) each year without having to report them as income.

In general, here are the federal taxes on different types of gambling winnings:

*Casino games: Gambling winnings from casino games are subject to regular income tax rates. In addition, there may be a federal excise tax of 0.25% on gaming revenue. This tax is paid by casinos only; it's not paid by players.

*Lottery prizes: Lottery prizes are subject to federal income tax rates and an additional 28% for federal withholding taxes. However, there's an exception for lottery prizes worth less than $5,000. These winnings aren't subject to withholding taxes if they're claimed within 60 days of the drawing or other event that resulted in the winning ticket.

*Winnings from horse races: Winnings from horse races are also subject to regular income tax rates and the related excise tax if applicable. In addition, there may be state taxes levied on these types of winnings depending on where the race took place.

As mentioned earlier, taxpayers can generally exclude up to $5,000 in gambling winnings (or $600 if they file a joint return) each year without having to report them as income. To qualify for this exclusion, however, taxpayers must meet certain requirements: The taxpayer must have gambled seriesly duringthe year; The taxpayer's gambling losses must exceed their gambling wins; and The taxpayer must provide documentation substantiating their gambling losses and wins (e.g., receipts, canceled checks).
