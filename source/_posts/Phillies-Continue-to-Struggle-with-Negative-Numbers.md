#  Phillies Continue to Struggle with Negative Numbers

The Phillies continue to struggle as they cannot seem to get out of the negative numbers. This was most evident in their game against the Padres on June 8th. The team only scored two runs and continued to have various fielding errors, which added to their overall score.

Their batting order continues to suffer from inconsistency with hitters like Odubel Herrera and Maikel Franco not performing up to their usual standards. Herrera, in particular, has been a disappointment this season as his batting average is currently at .217.

Overall, the Phillies need to work on getting out of their slump if they want any chance of making it to the playoffs this year. While there are still plenty of games left in the season, they cannot afford to keep playing poorly if they want to stay competitive in the division.

#  Nationals Slip in NL East, Record Shows Negative Numbers

The Washington Nationals have had a rough time in the National League East division this season. So far, their record stands at 41-41 as they slip further down the ranks. This poor performance is in stark contrast to their first place status at this point last year.

What has caused this team to stumble? There are multiple factors at play. For one, the offense has not been as consistent as it was in 2016. Bryce Harper, Daniel Murphy, and Ryan Zimmerman all had banner seasons last year but have yet to reach their usual production levels. Additionally, the bullpen has been unreliable, with several key players suffering from inconsistency or injuries.

Manager Dusty Baker has also come under fire for his decision-making; for example, pulling Max Scherzer too early from games and using struggling pitchers in high-pressure situations.

Despite all of these struggles, there is still time for the Nationals to turn things around. They are only four games out of first place and have plenty of talent on their roster. If they can get their offense going and find some stability in the bullpen, they could very well make a run for the playoffs.

#  Mets Shifting Focus to Future as Braves Pull Ahead with Negative Numbers

The Mets are in the midst of a rebuild, and it is apparent in their on-field product. The Braves, on the other hand, seem to be going in the opposite direction.

The Braves currently sit in first place in the NL East while the Mets are languishing in last. The Braves’ 33-22 record is good for a 0.600 winning percentage while the Mets’ 20-37 record is good for a 0.354 winning percentage.

The Braves have had more success than the Mets this season for a few reasons:

1. Depth of Young Talent: The Braves have several young players who have contributed this season, including Ronald Acuna Jr., Ozzie Albies, and Max Fried. The Mets only have Jacob DeGrom and Jeff McNeil who are under 30 years old and contributing at a high level.

2. Better Pitching: The Braves’ pitching staff has been much better than the Mets’ staff this season. Atlanta’s starters have a 3.32 ERA compared to 4.93 ERA for New York’s starters. Their relievers also have a better ERA (3.51) than the Mets’ relievers (4.48).

3. More Luck: Baseball is a game of luck, and sometimes teams just get lucky while other teams don’t. The Braves have been fortunate enough to avoid major injuries this season while the Mets have not been as lucky. In addition, the Braves have benefitted from some good bounces and timely hits, while the Mets have not had as much luck.

Despite their struggles this season, the Mets are still optimistic about their future. One reason for their optimism is that they believe their young players will continue to develop and improve over time. They also believe that their bullpen will improve once Jeurys Familia and Edwin Diaz return from injury.

The Braves, on the other hand, are less optimistic about their future since they lack young talent and are likely maxed out with their current roster construction. Their window for winning may close sooner than expected if they do not add some young talent in the near future

#  Phillies End Up on Wrong Side of History With Negative Numbers

The Philadelphia Phillies’ 2018 season is one for the record books, but not in a good way. They are the first team in MLB history to finish with negative numbers in batting average, home runs, and RBIs.

The Phillies had high hopes this year after signing free agent outfielder Carlos Santana and trading for starting pitcher Jake Arrieta. However, things did not go as planned. Santana only hit .229 and Arrieta went 10-11 with a 3.84 ERA. The rest of the team was equally unimpressive. No other Phillie had an average above .250 and the team as a whole batted just .234. They also only hit 168 home runs and drove in 558 runs – both league lows.

It was a disappointing season all around for the Phillies, who finished last in the NL East with a record of 66-96. There were a few bright spots, such as rookie outfielder J.P. Crawford who batted .242 in 102 games and starter Nick Pivetta who had an impressive 4.77 ERA over32 starts. But overall, it was a disappointing year for the Phils and their fans.

Philadelphia will look to rebound next season with some new additions and hope to finally get back into contention in the NL East.

#  Nationals Have Valley of Negativity Amidst Positive MLB Betting

The Washington Nationals were supposed to be a World Series contender this year, but right now they are looking like anything but. The Nationals have the valley of negativity amidst positive MLB betting action.

Washington is just 13-19 overall and 6-11 at home. They have been one of the biggest disappointments in baseball so far, and it’s not hard to see why when you look at their stats.

For starters, the Nationals’ starting pitching has been poor. Their team ERA of 4.74 is good for just 23rd in MLB. Additionally, Washington’s hitters have struggled as well. They are currently ranked 20th in batting average and 26th in runs scored.

On the bright side, the Nationals do have a few good players on their team. Bryce Harper is off to another strong start this season, and Max Scherzer has continued his dominance on the mound.

Overall, though, there is definitely a lot of negativity surrounding the Washington Nationals right now. If they want to turn their season around, they will need to start playing better as a team.
