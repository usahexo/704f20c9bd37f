#  When is Ohio Going to Get Sports Betting?

The Buckeye State could see legalized sports betting as soon as this year, pending the outcome of a lawsuit filed against the state by four major pro sports leagues and the NCAA.

On February 15th, 2018, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The defendants have until April 2nd to respond to the motion.

Mike DeWine is confident that Ohio will win the case and be able to offer legalized sports betting this year.

“Our position is clear,” DeWine said in a statement. “We believe that Ohio’s law is constitutional and that we will ultimately prevail in this case.”

The state of New Jersey has already won a similar case at the Supreme Court, which paves the way for other states to legalize sports betting.

If Ohio does win the case, it would join Delaware, Mississippi, Nevada and West Virginia as states with legalized sports betting.

#  State Gaming Commission Sets Timeline for Ohio Sports Betting

On Tuesday, the Ohio State Gaming Commission announced a timeline for implementing sports betting in the state. The plan calls for regulators to award the first licenses in early June, with sports books up and running by the start of the NFL season in September.

The move comes as a number of other states have already moved forward with legalizing sports betting in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s May 2018 ruling opening up the market. Delaware was the first state to offer legal sports bets, launching a mobile app on June 5. New Jersey followed suit later that month, and Pennsylvania is set to launch its own app on July 15.

While Ohio has been slower to move on legalizing sports betting, officials say that they want to take their time to get it right. “We want to be deliberate in our process and make sure we put in place regulations that protect consumers and promote responsible gaming while also allowing for a successful and vibrant industry,” said commission chairman Thomas E. Carr in a statement.

The commission has released a Request for Proposals (RFP) seeking proposals from companies interested in running sportsbooks in the state. The RFP sets out a wide range of requirements, including that operators have at least three years of experience in running a successful sportsbook and that they have agreements with major league sports teams or NCAA member institutions to offer bets on games involving those teams.

The timing of the launch will depend on how long it takes applicants to respond to the RFP and for the commission to award licenses. But officials say they are confident that sports betting will be up and running by September 1 at the latest.

#  Panel Recommends October Start for Ohio Sports Betting

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A state legislative committee on Wednesday unanimously recommended that lawmakers consider legalizing sports betting in Ohio in October.

The Legislative Sports Betting Study Committee voted 8-0 to forward the measure to the full House for consideration. The vote came after the panel heard from four witnesses, including two representing casino interests and two representing the state's horse racing industry.

Under the proposal, sports betting could take place at casinos and racinos, with the state taking a cut of the action. The state would also get a share of any wagers placed online or through telephone or other remote means.

State Rep. Robert Cupp, a Lima Republican who chairs the committee, said he expects the full House to vote on the proposal in May. He added that it's "still an uphill battle" to get the measure approved by both chambers of the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. John Kasich.

"There are a lot of details that still have to be worked out," Cupp said after Wednesday's meeting.

Lawmakers across the country have been grappling with how to respond to last year's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal law barring most states from authorizing sports betting. Some have opted to legalize it, while others are considering measures to block it or allow only limited forms of it.

Cupp said he doesn't see sports betting as a major revenue generator for Ohio but sees it as a way to help keep gambling dollars in-state. He also noted that it could provide some additional income for the state's horseracing industry, which has seen its revenue decline in recent years.

#  Ohioans Could Soon Start Betting on Sports

A proposal in the Ohio legislature could soon allow residents of the state to place bets on sporting events.

The legislation, which has been introduced by Rep. Robert Sprague, would legalize sports betting in Ohio and would allow the state’s casinos and racetracks to offer betting services. The bill would also allow for mobile betting, meaning that people could place bets from their phones or other devices.

Supporters of the bill say that it will bring new revenue to the state and will create jobs. They also argue that it is a common-sense measure that will keep people from placing bets illegally.

Opponents of the bill say that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. They also argue that it is unfair for the state to profit from gambling when so many people suffer from addiction problems.

It is not yet clear whether the bill will pass, but supporters are optimistic that it will be approved.

#  When Will Ohio Officially Offer Sports Betting?

In May of 2018, the US Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, which effectively banned sports betting outside of Nevada. Since then, several states have jumped on board, enacting legislation to allow for wagering on sports.

But what about Ohio? When will Buckeye State residents be able to place bets on their favorite team?

According to recent reports, lawmakers in Ohio are still working on a bill that would legalize and regulate sports betting in the state. However, there is no set timeline for when this bill might be introduced or passed.

One major hurdle facing legislators is how to split up the revenue generated by sports betting. There is currently a disagreement between Republicans and Democrats over who should get the majority of the money – the state or casino operators. This issue could delay passage of the bill for some time.

In the meantime, Ohio residents can already bet on sports through offshore sites. While it’s not as convenient as placing a bet at your local casino or racetrack, it’s still an option for those who want to take a chance on game outcomes.

It remains to be seen whether Ohio will join the other states in legalizing sports betting in 2019 or 2020, but there is certainly momentum behind making it happen. Keep an eye on developments in Buckeye State politics to see when you might be able to place your first legal bet on a game!
