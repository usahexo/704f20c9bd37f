        <h1 id="Nevada-Study-Shows-35-Percent-of-State’s-Population-is-Addicted-to-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Study-Shows-35-Percent-of-State’s-Population-is-Addicted-to-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Study Shows 35 Percent of State’s Population is Addicted to Sports Gambling"></a>Nevada Study Shows 35 Percent of State’s Population is Addicted to Sports Gambling</h1><p>A survey from the Nevada State Department of Taxation has found that 35 percent of the state’s population is addicted to sports gambling. The study, conducted in collaboration with the University of Nevada, Reno, also found that problem and pathological gamblers account for 10 percent and 5 percent of the population, respectively.</p>
<p>The research team surveyed 3,005 residents about their gambling habits, including how often they gamble, what types of gambling they participate in, and how much money they spend on gambling each year. They also asked participants if they had ever experienced problems as a result of their gambling.</p>
<p>“The results of this study are concerning,” said Dr. Nancy Petry, one of the researchers involved in the study. “Addiction to sports gambling can have serious consequences for individuals, families, and communities.”</p>
<p>The findings suggest that more work needs to be done to address problem gambling in Nevada. In addition to the negative impact on individuals and families, addiction to sports gambling can also lead to financial problems and criminal activity.</p>
<p>“It is important for people who gamble—or who know someone who gambles—to understand the risks associated with this behavior and seek help if needed,” said Petry.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know has a problem with sports gambling, there is help available. The National Council on Problem Gambling offers a toll-free helpline (1-800-522-4700) as well as an online chat service.</p>
<h1 id="Addiction-to-Sports-Gambling-Hits-Every-State-in-the-U-S"><a href="#Addiction-to-Sports-Gambling-Hits-Every-State-in-the-U-S" class="headerlink" title="Addiction to Sports Gambling Hits Every State in the U.S."></a>Addiction to Sports Gambling Hits Every State in the U.S.</h1><p>According to a study released by the University of Montana, addiction to sports gambling has hit every state in the U.S. The study also found that there is a direct correlation between gambling addictions and financial problems, relationship issues, and mental health concerns.</p>
<p>The study tracked data from nearly 4,000 people who admitted they had a gambling problem. Results showed that more than half of all respondents reported at least one major life issue due to their addiction. Financial problems were the most common, followed by relationship issues and mental health concerns.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Assistant Professor Michael Latham, said that the findings should serve as a warning to policymakers and the public about the risks of sports gambling. “This research provides some of the first empirical evidence that problem gambling rates are elevated in states where sports betting is legal,” Latham said. “It also documents the many negative consequences that can result from this type of gambling.”</p>
<p>Latham added that while casinos and lotteries have been around for many years, sports betting is a relatively new phenomenon. He cautioned that with its increasing popularity, there is a growing potential for addiction-related problems. “As we move forward with legalization of sports betting at the state level, it is important to be aware of these risks so that policy decisions can be made in light of this evidence,” he said.</p>
<p>The findings of the study come as no surprise to those working in the addiction treatment field. “We’ve been seeing an increase in gambling addictions for years now,” said Jane Velez-Mitchell, host of HLN’s “In Session.” “People are getting addicted to all sorts of wagers - from fantasy football leagues to online poker.”</p>
<p>Velez-Mitchell noted that many people don’t realize they have a problem until it’s too late. “Most addicts try to hide their addiction for as long as possible,” she said. “They’re ashamed and embarrassed.”</p>
<p>The good news is that there is help available for those who suffer from a gambling addiction. Treatment options include counseling and therapy, medication, and support groups like Gamblers Anonymous.</p>
<h1 id="More-than-Half-of-All-American-Adults-are-Addicted-to-Gambling-on-Sports"><a href="#More-than-Half-of-All-American-Adults-are-Addicted-to-Gambling-on-Sports" class="headerlink" title="More than Half of All American Adults are Addicted to Gambling on Sports"></a>More than Half of All American Adults are Addicted to Gambling on Sports</h1><p>A recent study from the University of Oregon found that more than half of all American adults are addicted to gambling on sports. The study, which was conducted in partnership with the NCAA, surveyed over 5,000 college athletes and found that 58% of them admitted to gambling on sports in some form or another. This number is especially troubling when you consider that only 47% of the general population admits to gambling on sports.</p>
<p>The reasons for this addiction vary from person to person, but there are a few common threads. Many people enjoy the feeling of excitement and adrenaline that comes with gambling, and they find it difficult to resist the temptation to gamble when they see an opportunity. Additionally, many people see gambling as a way to make money, and they are often drawn in by the potential profits.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason, gambling addiction can be extremely harmful both physically and mentally. Gambling can lead to financial problems, stress, anxiety, and depression. In extreme cases, it can even lead to suicide.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is addicted to gambling on sports, there is help available. There are a variety of rehab programs available that can help you overcome your addiction. Seek out help today if you feel like you’re struggling with gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-70-Percent-of-Americans-Gamble-on-Sports-with-Many-Becoming-Addicted"><a href="#Study-Shows-70-Percent-of-Americans-Gamble-on-Sports-with-Many-Becoming-Addicted" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows 70 Percent of Americans Gamble on Sports, with Many Becoming Addicted"></a>Study Shows 70 Percent of Americans Gamble on Sports, with Many Becoming Addicted</h1><p>A recent study by the University of Las Vegas has shown that almost seventy percent of Americans engage in some form of sports gambling, with many becoming addicted to the rush of winning.</p>
<p>The study surveyed over three thousand people and found that while the majority of gamblers only bet on sports occasionally, a significant minority (almost twenty-five percent) bet on sports regularly and even more (thirty-six percent) admit to having becoming addicted to gambling.</p>
<p>Most people who gamble on sports do so out of boredom or to make some extra money, but for a small minority, gambling can become a serious problem. Gambling addiction can lead to financial problems, ruined relationships and even criminal behavior as addicts try to get their hands on more money to continue betting.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to get help before it becomes too late. There are a number of treatment options available, including counseling, therapy and medication. Talk to your doctor or a trusted friend or family member about what you can do to get started on the road to recovery.</p>

<li><p>The American Gaming Association (AGA) has released new figures indicating that U.S. addiction to sports gambling skyrockets as online betting increases.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The study, which was commissioned by the AGA and conducted by Oxford Economics, found that in 2018 Americans wagered $107.4 billion on sports, up from $84.6 billion in 2017. In addition, the amount of money wagered illegally on sports tripled between 2013 and 2018, from $17.4 billion to $52.4 billion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>While illegal gambling is a major problem, the study also found that legal sports betting is growing rapidly. In 2018, states that have legalized sports betting took in $2.8 billion in bets, up from $2018 million in 2017.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“As legalized sports betting spreads across the country, so too does problem gambling,” said Geoff Freeman, President and CEO of the American Gaming Association. “These numbers underscore the need for strong consumer protections that include safeguards against underage and compulsive gambling. At the same time, we remain optimistic about the potential for legalized sports betting to create jobs and generate government revenue while keeping gaming out of the hands of criminals.”</p>
